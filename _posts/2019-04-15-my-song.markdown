<br>Long have I longed
<br>to sing a song
<br>it is my tale
<br>before I grew cold and pale
<br>the story of my life
<br>colourful and bright
<br>over the peaks I flew
<br>where I saw only a few
<br>a darkness I didn't foresee
<br>like a basilisk, it swallowed me
<br>I went numb, and I fell
<br>to a city, with a story to tell
<br>I sang until I had my breath
<br>but it fell on ears that were deaf
<br>still as a stone, silent as the grave now I lie
<br>without a light, just waiting to die
