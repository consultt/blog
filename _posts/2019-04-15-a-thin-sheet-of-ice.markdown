<br>On a foggy day
<br>sight ends a fathom away
<br>no lights to guide
<br>I stand on a sheet of ice
<br>
<br>I search for a rope
<br>O any sign! A ray of hope
<br>but in vain my effort lies
<br>I stand on a sheet of ice
<br>
<br>I think to move in ways more than a dozen
<br>but help me, god! My legs are frozen
<br>I cannot move whatever I try
<br>I stand frozen on a sheet of ice
<br>
<br>In the darkness of the night
<br>my heart pounds, I stand in fright
<br>It becomes harder to breathe as time passes by
<br>I stand frozen on a sheet of ice
<br>
<br>I look down at the ice
<br>it is thin but I see a light
<br>covered in darkness, deep down it lies
<br>a shining star beneath this sheet of ice
<br>
<br>It is my only hope
<br>anywhere else I do not see even the thinnest rope
<br>and hence I decide to take a dive
<br>bidding a farewell to the world above the ice
<br>
<br>I plunged inside and began to stroke
<br>towards the light, my source of hope
<br>the world seemed calm, a darkness descended
<br>I had a smile, my pain has ended.
