<br>No wind to take me home
<br>I travel aimless and alone
<br>wondering how long will it last
<br>in a desert, dead, empty, and vast
<br>
<br>I remember my days of past
<br>on a road, untravelled by the mass
<br>today I just think of my past
<br>in a desert, dead, empty, and vast
<br>
<br>The road was tough, long, and steep
<br>nevertheless, I travelled without rest and sleep
<br>I knew not I will end up here at last
<br>in a desert, dead, empty, and vast
<br>
<br>To a tree, was the road leading me
<br>full of love and soul she was to be
<br>but became a mirage without a heart
<br>in a desert, dead, empty, and vast
<br>
<br>A truth I learned, which tore me apart
<br>that it's all nothing, but just a mirage
<br>everything vanished, at a pace so fast
<br>and left a desert, dead, empty, and vast
<br>
<br>today I am left with an empty heart
<br>searching for a road, wind, or a star
<br>that takes me home where I find a heart
<br>and not a desert, dead, empty, and vast
