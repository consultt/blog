<p>
 I am a student undergraduate doing majors in Physics and minors in        English Literature from IIT Kanpur. I have several hobbies, like,         singing, swimming, and playing Bansuri(not to be confused with Venu,      Indian Classical) and piano(Western Classical compositions). I also       enjoy going on long-distance cycling trips, reading novels, and writing   poems.

<p>
 I also like to challenge myself. In the past I have taken challenges      like reading 50 books in a year, learning a language to a certain         extent, etc., which I have managed to finish.

<p>
 I am also learning a few languages these days. I am focusing mainly on    French as of now, but apart from that I am also trying to learn Bangla    and Telugu.

<p>
 This year also I have taken a challenge to read 50 books, but I am        hoping to push it to 60 or more. Apart from this I am also trying to get  disciplined, by doing a set of activities daily. They include practicing  piano, practicing French, running and workouts, and studying. I am        hoping to achieve a good streak in doing these activities.
